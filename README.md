# LED Control with Windows Forms Application and Arduino üåü

This project utilizes C# with .NET Framework to develop a Windows Forms application that controls the state of LEDs connected to an Arduino Mega. Communication between the application and Arduino is achieved via a serial interface using the IO Ports library in C#. The Arduino is programmed in C++ to receive serial commands from the application and control the LEDs.

## Project Details ‚ÑπÔ∏è

- **Languages Used:**
  - C# (.NET Framework)
  - C++ (Arduino)

- **IDE Used:**
  - Visual Studio Community

- **Libraries:**
  - IO Ports (C#) for serial communication between the Windows Forms application and Arduino.

## Features üöÄ

- The Windows Forms application allows sending serial commands to the Arduino.
- The Arduino interprets received commands and controls the state of two LEDs.

## Setup üîß

1. **Development Environment:**
   - Install Visual Studio Community for C# development.
   - Set up the Arduino IDE for programming the Arduino in C++.

2. **Serial Connection Setup:**
   - Verify serial port settings in Visual Studio Community and Arduino code for compatibility.

3. **Running the Project:**
   - Compile and run the Windows Forms application in Visual Studio.
   - Upload the Arduino code and verify serial communication.
